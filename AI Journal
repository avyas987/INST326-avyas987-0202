Week 1: 9/7/2025

This week, I only used AI (ChatGPT and Gemini) to help me clearly understand booleans, floats, f-strings, slicing, '.find()' command and many other Python concepts. Not only did I use AI to teach me content but also to boost my confidence in knowing that I am doing this assignment correctly. Since I did not use AI to solve any of the answers on the assignment, I felt a lot better about myself because I was seriously learning new material that I am interested in - even if it meant spending more time on the work.

I also hope to be able to work as a team without using AI
